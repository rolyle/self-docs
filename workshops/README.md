## Workshop 1 [Saying Hello](./Workshop1-SayingHello/lab-docs/workshop_1.md)
In this workshop, you install Intu on your laptop and get it to say hello to you.

## Workshop 2 [Customizing the Conversation Service](./Workshop2-CustomizingTheConversationService/lab-docs/workshop_2.md)
In this workshop, you customize the greeting in the dialog from the Conversation service workspace and extend the conversation by adding new intents, new entities, and new dialog.

## Workshop 3 [Creating an emotion agent](./Workshop3-CreatingAnEmotionAgent/lab-docs/workshop_3.md)
In this workshop, you create an emotion agent. Agents make decisions about how Intu operates and responds. The emotion agent uses the Tone Analyzer service on Bluemix, which analyzes a person's tone and determines whether that tone is positive or negative.

## Workshop 4 [Customizing Intu to call your phone](./Workshop4-CustomizingIntuToCallYourPhone/lab-docs/workshop_4.md)
In this workshop, you will configure Intu's telephony plan to have Intu call your phone by using the Nexmo Cloud Communications API.

## Workshop 5 [Running Intu on a Raspberry Pi](./Workshop5â€“RunningIntuOnARaspberryPi/lab-docs/workshop_5.md)
In this workshop, you will assemble your own Raspberry Pi, which is a credit card-sized computer. You will then program an LED gesture for Intu, and run Intu off of your Raspberry Pi and see your LED gesture in action.

## Workshop 6 [Creating a camera sensor](./Workshop6-CreatingACameraSensor/lab-docs/workshop_6.md)
In this workshop, you create a camera sensor. Sensors take in data from the outside world to process. The camera sensor will aim to take in visual data from the environment, ready to be processed on Intu.

## Workshop 7 [Installing, configuring, and running the Intu Avatar](./Workshop7-InstallingConfiguringAndRunningTheIntuAvatar/lab-docs/workshop_7.md)
In this workshop, you install, configure, and run the Intu Avatar. You can use the avatar when you do not have a visual embodiment for Intu. Additionally, the avatar is useful in noisy environments because you can interact with it by using the keyboard instead of the microphone.
