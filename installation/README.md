# Intu

[Back](../README.md)
 
Intu is an architecture that enables Watson services in devices that perceive by vision, audition, olfaction, sonar, infrared energy, temperature, and vibration. Intu-enabled devices express themselves and interact with their environments, other devices, and people through speakers, actuators, gestures, scent emitters, lights, navigation, and more.

## Before you begin

  * To use Intu, you must have a Bluemix account. To register for a Bluemix account, go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/. 
  * Ensure your hardware meets the following requirements:

      * 2 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)
      * 1 GB of available hard-disk space for 32-bit installation; 1 GB of available hard-disk space for 64-bit installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on a volume that uses a case-sensitive file system)
      * 1024 x 768 display (1280x800 recommended) with 16-bit color and 512 MB of dedicated VRAM; 2 GB is recommended
      * OpenGL 2.0–capable system
      * CPU: SSE2 instruction set support
      * Graphics card: DX9 (shader model 3.0) or DX11 with feature level 9.3 capabilities.
      * Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, validation of subscriptions, and access to online services.

    * Mac OS
    
      * Multicore Intel processor with 64-bit support
