# Reminder: Update your services within 30 days of registering on the Intu Gateway
Your instance of Intu is pre-configured with the following Watson services from <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net" data-popup="true">Bluemix</a>: Conversation, Weather Company Data, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech. The pre-configuration is enabled for 30 days. If you want to continue to use Intu after 30 days, you must create your own instances of these services and configure Intu to use them. 

**This page will walk you through the following:**

1. [Creating and configuring the necessary services for Intu](#required-services)
2. [What extra functionality is available if you create and configure additional services](#additional-functionality)
3. [Creating and configuring optional services for Intu](#creating-additional-services)

## B. <a name="additional-functionality">Additional functionality that can be used with Intu</a>
While only Conversation, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech are required for running Intu, you can add more Bluemix services for even more usability.  In the section below you can read about additional Intu features that can be used if you have the necessary Bluemix services configured in your Intu Gateway.

Note: For the features listed below to work, you need to use the Conversation workspace downloaded from the **Intu Starter Kit** located on the <a href="https://rg-gateway.mybluemix.net/Downloads" target="_blank">Intu Gateway Downloads</a> page. You can use this workspace in addition to any other ones you would like to use. See [Workshop 2](./workshops/Workshop2-CustomizingTheConversationService/lab-docs/README.md) for more details.

1. **Greeter Agent**: Intu will greet you!  For this to work you need to have your camera turned on. If you are running Intu on a Mac, Windows, or Nao robot device and are using the Intu Starter Kit Conversation workspace, simply saying _"turn the camera on"_ will turn your camera on.

	* Additional Bluemix services required: **Visual Recognition**
	
	Note: For a more personalized greeting, see **Name Agent** below.
	
2. **Weather Agent**: Get Intu to tell you about the weather! Examples of weather-related questions you can ask: _"What is the weather in Boston"_ or _"What will the weather be like in Las Vegas on Friday"_.

	* Additional Bluemix services required: **Natural Language Understanding** and **Weather Company Data**
	
3. **Time Agent**: Get Intu to tell you what time it is! Examples of time-related questions you can ask: _"What time is it right now"_ or _"What time is it in Tokyo"_.

	* Additional Bluemix services required: **Natural Language Understanding** and **Weather Company Data**
	
4. **Name Agent**: You can rename your Intu device or get Intu to learn your name! Examples of name-related queries you can tell Intu: _"Your name is now Bobby"_ or _"My name is John"_.  Once Intu learns your name, it will greet you by name using the **Greeter Agent** mentioned above.

	* Additional Bluemix services required (for renaming only): **Natural Language Understanding**
	* Additional Bluemix services required (for learning your name): **Natural Language Understanding** and **Visual Recognition**

	
5. **Telephony Agent**: Get Intu to call you or someone else! Please see [Workshop 4](./workshops/Workshop4-CustomizingIntuToCallYourPhone/lab-docs/README.md) for more details on how to configure and use the Telephony Agent.

	* Additional services required: **Nexmo** -- _note: This is **NOT** a Bluemix service_
